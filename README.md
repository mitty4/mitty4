### Hi There üëã,
- - - - 
- My name is Mitchell LaBauve.
- I am a fullstack software engineer.

<br>



### üìñ My Story:
- - - - 
- I am extremely grateful for every opportunity that I have had to learn and grow in more than just technical roles.
- One example is I worked as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT-B) working on an ambulance for 2.5 years.
- This part of my background is worth mentioning because it enabled me to develop deep communication skills that have been very helpful in my software engineering roles.
- I really enjoy working with people and I have an unshakeable passion for writing code and solving problems.
- Check out some of my personal projects below...

### ‚è∞ The Crowd Favorite:

I prototyped & programmed a robotic lawn mower using:
<br>

Software        |         |Hardware                              |
-------------   |---------|-------------                         |
Python          |         |21" push mower                        |
OpenCV          |         |Wheelchair Motors                |
Neural Networks |         |GLONASS                               |
Stereo Vision   |         |Dual Motor Driver                     |
Linux           |         |NVidia Jetson Nano ( for the edge GPU)|
Git             |         |
Object Oriented Programming | | |

 1. First, I built the from-scratch prototype to be remote controlled (I get funny looks from my neighbors when mowing my lawn from a chair on my porch). 
 2. Then, I programmed the automated navigation with Python, serial ports and GLONASS (although the custom PID control really put a damper on the project).
 3. Next, I could add obstacle avoidance using binocular vision and OpenCV (I would synthesize a cutting edge technique only found in reasearch papers - called the Manduchi Algorithm.. or so I think I could!).

### üõ†Ô∏è More Projects We Should Discuss
- - - - 
   - __Microgreens Farming Innovation and E-Commerce Website__ to order/subscribe to microgreen orders grown with my automoated process. (full-stack website) 
   - __API Quant Trader__ using the TD Ameritrade API (algorithmic trading before TD Ameritrade became Charles Schwab)
   - __UI Wireframe Mockup__ for a health company idea (ui developer/designer)
   - __GoLang Encryption Tool__ to encrypt/decrypt files from the command line

### üèÉ Where I'm Going... 
- - - - 
   - I have found that I work best in start ups and small companies. However, I am open to discussing any opportunity.
