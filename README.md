### Hi There üëã,
- - - - 
- My name is Mitchell LaBauve.
- I recently learned how to data science - because understanding data is our future.
- I am also a developer.

<br>



### üìñ My Story:
- - - - 
- Professionally, I left the tech space.
- Now, I am looking to re-enter a developer role.
- Honestly, the developer never left me... see for yourself.  


<br>
<br>


### ‚è∞ Currently,
- - - - 
I'm prototyping & programming a robotic lawn mower using:
<br>

Software        |         |Hardware                              |
-------------   |---------|-------------                         |
Python          |         |21" push mower                        |
OpenCV          |         |Wheelchair Motors                |
Neural Networks |         |GLONASS                               |
Stereo Vision   |         |Dual Motor Driver                     |
Linux           |         |NVidia Jetson Nano ( for the edge GPU)|
Git             |         |
Object Oriented Programming | | |

 <br>
 <br>
 
 1. First, I built the from-scratch prototype to be remote controlled (I get funny looks from my neighbors when mowing my lawn from a chair on my porch). 
 2. Now, I am programming the automated navigation with Python, serial ports and GLONASS (I will soon have free weekends during the summer to do more automation projects like this one).
 3. Next, I will add obstacle avoidance using binocular vision and OpenCV (I will synthesize a cutting edge technique learned from reading reasearch papers - called the manduchi algorithm.. or so I think I will).
 
 <br>
 <br>
 
### üõ†Ô∏è More Projects We Should Discuss
- - - - 
   - __Website for RSVPing__ to track attendance for my wedding (full-stack website) 
   - __API Quant Trader__ using the TD Ameritrade API (algorithmic trading)
   - __UI Wireframe Mockup__ for a health company idea (ui developer/designer)
   - __Automatic Program__ to categorize and total my monthly budget

<br>

### üèÉ Where I'm Going... 
- - - - 
   - I am interested in joining a small company that fosters continual growth in the healthcare or IT industry and makes use of data in it's decision making.
