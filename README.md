### Hi 👋,

I'm Mitchell LaBauve, a developer at my core ...just wait - you'll see!


### 📖 My Story:
Professionally, I left the tech space... but the developer stayed with me. 

Now, I am making my way back into a developer role. 


### Currently,
I'm prototyping & programming a robotic lawn mower using:

            * Python - object oriented programming,
            * OpenCV, 
(software)  * Neural Networks, 
            * Stereo Vision,
            * Linux 

            * 21" push mower, 
            * used wheelchair motors, 
(hardware)  * GLONASS, 
            * dual motor driver,
            * NVidia Jetson Nano (for the edge GPU)


 
### More Projects,
        * **RSVP website** to track attendance for my wedding (full-stack), 
        * **Quant trader** using the TD Ameritrade API (algorithms), 
        * **Wireframe mockup** for a health company idea (ui developer/designer)
        * **Program** to categorize and total my monthly budget 

        

### Where I'm Going... 
        * I want to find a company that let's me learn and then use what I learn.

        * AWS,

        * Docker, 
        * Git,  
        * HTML,
